## Current Dependencies
This project uses the [Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561), see the troubleshooting section if you run into any problems. Also make sure to install the Microsoft.Kinect.VisualGestureBuilder NuGet package. 

## Troubleshooting
- `kinect service host cannot be found`
We ran into this issue at the start of the project, which we did `Win+R--->services.msc--->KinectMonitor` and restarted the service.
